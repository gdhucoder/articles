a.few key words

b.complies fast

c.concurrency

d. garbage collector



## 开发速度

因为编译执行快。静态类型，类型安全。

That exchange is also synchronized, and both goroutines can have
guarantees the exchange has been made. This safe exchange of data between goroutines requires no other locks or synchronization mechanisms.

## Go的类型系统

无需继承，最大限度的
